# SOC Alert Triage Using Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) & Analyst-in-the-Loop  
### Reducing Alert Fatigue in Security Operations Centers (SOC)

This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and automation for the project  
**“Reducing SOC Alert Fatigue Using Semi-Supervised Tri-Training and Analyst-in-the-Loop Feedback."**

The goal is to build an AI-driven alert-triage pipeline that operates under realistic SOC constraints:
- **Minimal labeled data** (only 10% labeled, 90% unlabeled)
- **High recall requirement** 
- **Temporal drift** (Train: Mon–Thu, Test: Friday)
- **Real-world integration** (Wazuh SIEM)
- **Human feedback loop** (AITL learning)

# 📌 Project Overview

Modern SOCs receive thousands of alerts per day, most of which are false positives.  
Alert fatigue leads to missed incidents and overwhelmed analysts.

This project develops a **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) alert triage system** capable of:

### ✔ Automatically closing safe alerts  
### ✔ Escalating high-risk alerts  
### ✔ Sending uncertain alerts to analysts  
### ✔ Improving continuously from analyst feedback  

The system uses:
- **Tri-Training SSL** (three-model consensus pseudo-labeling)
- **Evasion-aware feature engineering**
- **Isolation-Forest anomaly signals**
- **Safety thresholding (Recall ≥ 99.9%)**
- **Analyst-in-the-Loop retraining**
- **Wazuh alert ingestion for final deployment**

# 🧪 **Methodology**

## **1.  Preprocessing Engine**
A robust, leakage-proof transformer that:

### ✔ Cleans + standardizes raw CICIDS2017  
✔ Extracts timestamps and applies Mon–Thu vs Friday split  
✔ Computes:
- Stateless features (ratios, flag anomalies, time features)
- Stateful features (port rarity, protocol rarity)
- Anomaly scores from **Isolation Forest** trained ONLY on benign traffic  

### ✔ Saves:
- `train_mon_thu.parquet`
- `test_friday.parquet`
- Metadata (feature list, distributions)

## **3. Safety-First Triage Engine**
Instead of using a naive classification threshold (0.5), we compute a threshold such that:

### **Recall_attack ≥ 99.9%  
False Negative Rate ≤ 0.1%**

The threshold is learned using a calibration set.

### Output:
- **Auto-Close Alerts** – very low probability of attack  
- **Review Alerts** – uncertain, analyst should inspect  
- **Critical Alerts** – high probability of attack  

This guarantees **zero major misses** even in SSL-based systems.

## **4. Analyst-in-the-Loop (AITL)**
A realistic simulation where the model improves as analysts verify uncertain alerts.

Each round:
1. Select most-uncertain alerts  
2. Reveal true labels  
3. Retrain Tri-Training  
4. Measure improvement in ROC, AP, Recall

Produces a **learning curve** that shows how SOC effectiveness compounds over time.
